## Usage

**catimage** prints the images of the files provided as arguments (or from stdin if none is provided). The ANSI escape sequences for 24-bit color are used in combonation with the half block character to simulate square pixels. The image is scalled down to fit into the terminal size. 

### Options

- `-n`: scale down by image by nearest neighbor (less smooth image)
- `-f`: fit image only by width
- `-s`: show images one by one (press enter to continue)
- `-i`: ignore missing or unsupported files
- `-w INTEGER`, `-h INTEGER`: set the max width or height
